Interactive Resume

This project was built using a JS script that combines personal information with pre-written HTML and CSS templates to generate my resume.  Used basic Javascript syntax which includes manipulating data types (like JSON), building loops and creating functions.  Also used simple JQuery DOM manipulations methods to build the resume.

Process

The resume has four distinct sections: work, education, projects and a header with biographical information.

1. Build four JSON objects, each one representing a different resume section.

2. Iterate through each JSON object and append its information to index.html in the correct section.
 
3. The resume includes an interactive map.
